			<h1>JavaScript in A level Computer Science</h1>
			Learners are expected to be able to follow and write basic JavaScript code. It is hoped they will get practical experience of JavaScript in their study of the course:
				<ul> 
					<li>They will not be expected to commit exact details of syntax to memory. Questions in the exam will not penalise learners for minor inaccuracies in syntax.</li> <br>
					<li>Learners will be expected to be familiar with the JavaScript equivalents of the structures listed in the pseudo code section (with the exception of input and output (see below). </li> <br>
					<li>They will not be expected to use JavaScript for Object Oriented programming or file handling. </li> <br> 
					<li>Questions will not be asked in JavaScript where something is passed to a subroutine by value or reference is relevant. </li> <br>
					<li>Input will be taken in by reading values from a form. NB learners will not be expected to memorise the method for doing this as focus will be on what they do with that input once it is received.</li> <br>
					<li>Output By changing the contents of an HTML element 
						<code>chosenElement = document.getElementById(“example”); <br>
						chosenElement.innerHTML = “Hello World”; <br>
						</code>
					</li> <br>
					<li>By writing directly to the document - <br>
						<code>
							document.write(“Hello World”); <br>
							By using an alert box alert(“Hello World”); <br>
						</code>
 					</li> <br>
				</ul>
